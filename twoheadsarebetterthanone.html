    <h2> Two heads are better than one - pair programming and beyond</h2>
<i>2016-06-30</i>
<p>Pair programming isn't really a controversial topic any longer.  The real cool
kids are even talking about mob and full team programming.  However, I wanted
to talk about this to lead into a more general post on the social aspects of 
programming at a later date, so here we go!</p>
<p>To me, paired programming is a tool in the toolbox - it isn't something that I
do every day, it is a situational option, but one I've used when necessary or
convenient for the past 15 years.  Times I think it is really handy are for
mentoring or when the problem is difficult and the solution is either unknown 
or sketchy.  Let me talk about each in turn.</p>
<p>First of all, for mentoring - I think this is a mentoring style that is really
tough to beat.  Yes, it means that the experienced programmer is really 
committed to doing that mentoring, but that's what a mentor is for - if you 
aren't providing that focussed attention and teaching for at least some of the
time, you aren't really mentoring.  When using paired programming for mentoring,
the learning programmer should always be the one at the controls.  The mentor
needs to grab a tea, relax, and adopt a teaching, patient state of mind. 
There's a lot of things that will get missed if the mentor is controlling -
all the tricks that someone who has been living and breathing in an environment
for years does without thought - the IDE shortcuts, the debugging methods,
the library routines - those are all better learned through doing.</p>
<p>I'll write a whole blog at some point on mentoring - but for now, just remember
that when you're mentoring, you are supposed to guide the person you are
mentoring to find the answers and solutions, not just provide it for them.</p>
<p>The second place paired programming works are those difficult problems where the
solution isn't fully defined.  If you know exactly what you are doing, what the
plan is, it probably isn't worth it.  It is when you are a bit in the dark, 
where there's some direction but no lit path, that's where paired programming
comes into its own.  I should mention here that I've also done this with a trio,
and that seems to work fine too.  I've never tried the full team mobbing of one
problem - I read an interesting <a href="http://underthehood.meltwater.com/blog/2016/06/01/mob-programming/?utm_content=buffer3094c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer" target=_blank>
article</a> on it, but it is a significant rethinking of team dynamics and my
current team projects haven't really been appropriate to giving it a try - 
and I'm honestly not sold on it as a concept anyways.  But maybe one day, but
till then, paired programming to tackle those meaty problems remains an
excellent technique.  </p>
<p>When two (or more) experienced programmers sit down to pair program, it matters
a lot less who is at the keyboard.  That decision comes down to preference - 
maybe there's one person who really wants to be at the controls and the other
doesn't care.  Maybe they switch off.  All that matters is that everyone is
happy, that everyone is cool.  Everyone needs to play nicely together - 
compatibility does matter.  There are many styles of programming and I think
to pair program effectively, you need to have compatible styles.  You need to
be able to follow what the other person is doing or thinking.  I've had a few
teammates who were excellent programmers, but who I found it more difficult
to pair program with.  On the other hand, I've had some pair programming
partners where we were in incredible sync that we were just tearing through
some serious problems.  </p>
<p>I find those times really fun - though quite tiring.  Paired programming not
only is efficient, it is also very focussed - email tends to get ignored until
the task is done, people who swing by your cube and see two people tend to come
back later.  It means a very intense programming session, especially when things
go well.  That's pretty awesome and a great way to deal with heavy problems.</p>
<p>I don't, however, think pair programming is something that can be really
mandated - there is too much need for chemistry and compatability in the pairs.
I think it should be encouraged (or certainly not DIScouraged, which I've heard
about happening), but programmers work in different styles and different ways
and people shoudl do whatever makes them most productive.</p>
<p>I'll go on in my next blog to talk about my belief that programming is a social
work, not a solitary one, for anything bigger than a breadbox.  Till then, if
you haven't tried pair programming, give it a shot.  If you have, feel free to
let me know what you do differently. </p>
